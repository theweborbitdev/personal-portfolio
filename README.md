# 🚀 Portfolio Website – Ali Ahmad  

This is my **personal portfolio website** built with **React, Vite, and TailwindCSS**. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in a clean, modern, and responsive interface.

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Vite 7** – Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and HMR.  
- **TailwindCSS 3** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.  
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** – Smooth scroll animations.  
- **Neon** – (Optional library you installed, used for glowing text/effects).
